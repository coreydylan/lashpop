    text: "I recently had my lashes done here by Emily. I can't even tell you how amazed I am with my lashes. I was so afraid to get them done after a horrible experience years ago. Emily listened to my concerns and did EXACTLY what I wanted. I've seen some awful jobs done and you won't have that experience here. I am crazy about reviews before going anywhere and LashPop lives to the 5 star ratings they hold. I am beyond thankful I ended up there.",
